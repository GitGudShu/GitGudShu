## <font color="#FFD700">**About me**</font>

I’m a Data Science Engineer Apprentice at FEMTO-ST, based in the SADIAND Lab, where I work on AI and distributed algorithms to support emergency response operations in collaboration with SDIS 25. My role spans full stack development, technical team coordination, and contributing to research efforts that bridge theory and field application.
I studied computer science in France, explored machine learning research during a stay in the UK, and spent six months in Canada working on related topics before returning to France to focus on applied AI. I try to design systems that are useful, robust, and grounded in operational reality with the means and skills I have now. It’s a work in progress, and I’m always looking to improve.

I practiced jujitsu for years but lately not so much. Life got busy, priorities shifted, but I’d like to get back to it at some point. It’s one of those things that teaches you a lot, even when you're not doing it.
I also used to compose music more regularly now I just collect unfinished drafts like some people collect tabs. Still, I’m hoping to find more time for it again. Not everything needs a use case.

## <font color="#FFD700">**Projects**</font>

I’m always exploring new ideas probably why I’m juggling more projects than I have time for. You can find some of my latest experiments (AI and otherwise) in the repositories section of my GitHub. It’s where I collect the things I’ve been building, learning, or just messing around with. Feel free to take a look if you're curious.
